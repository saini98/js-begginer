 <!-- 
1. Promises are used to handle asynchronus operations in js

2. They are easy to manage when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations where callbacks can create a callback hell 
   leading to unmanageable code.

3. It is an object that keep track about whether a certain event is happened already or not.

4. Determines what happens after the events happened.

5. Promise has 3 stages :- 1. Pending , 2. Resolve , 3. Reject.

 <script>
    const calle = () => {
       return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
          setTimeout(()=> {
             const data = 'Sahil'
              resolve(data);
             reject('Connection Error')            
          }, 2000)
       })
    }
    calle().then((data)=> {
       console.log('Hi', data);
    }).catch((error)=>{
       console.log(error)
    })
 </script>
