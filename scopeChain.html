<!-- 
    1. The Scope Chain is used to resolve the value of variable names in js.

    2. Scope Chain in js is lexically(where we write a function) defined, which means that we can see
       what the scope chain will be by looking at the code .

    3. Lexical Scoping: Inner function can get access to their parent functions variables . But the 
        vice versa is not TRUE, means parent functions variable cannot access inner functions variables.
